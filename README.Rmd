This is meant to provide a worked example of applying standardization (G-computation) to a binary outcome in R.



## How to Use This Repo:

  1. Make sure you have the latest version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://posit.co/downloads/) installed.
  
  2. Make sure that your packages are up to date (see `update.packages()`).
  
  3. If using Windows, install [RTools: Toolchains](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Mac and Linux should already have compilers available for building packages from source.
  
  4. Open R Studio: Select `File` > `New Project` > `Version Control` > `Git`:
  
    - In the `Repository URL:` field, paste `https://github.com/CovariateAdjustment/BinaryOutcomeTutorial`
    - In the `Project directory name:` field, paste `BinaryOutcomeTutorial`
    - Choose a directory for cloning the repo.
  
  5. R Studio will open the project once it is cloned:  Run `1_install_required_packages.r`: This will install packages from R and CRAN.
  

After these steps are complete, open `binary_outcome_tutorial_walkthrough.Rmd`: This R Markdown report provides a step-by-step example of materials in the slides.

## Code in Repository

### Helper Functions

  1. `g_computation.R` contains `analysis_g_computation()`, which can be used to produce point estimates as well as a standard errors (SE) and confidence interval (CI). SE and CI can be computed using the nonparametric bootstrap. SE and CI is available for some estimands using influence functions.
  
  2. `boot_p_value.R` contains `boot_p_value()` which can take a `boot` object produced by `boot::boot()` and calculate a p-value by finding the smallest confidence level at which the CI no longer contains the null value.


### Rmarkdown Report

  - `binary_outcome_tutorial_walkthrough.Rmd` shows a reproducible report that walks through all of the examples in the presentation.
